This folder contains the source code of **MPNN: Nearest Neighbor Library for Motion Planning**, developed by Anna Yershova and Steven M. LaValle, and is subject to its license. For more information, visit this [website](https://lavalle.pl/software/mpnn/mpnn.html).

We have made a few modifications to the library and added Python bindings to enable its use with our project.

To compile the library and create the Python bindings for your system, use the supplied Makefile by running `make` in the terminal while in this folder. Alternatively, you can compile the bindings manually. In this case, refer to the pybind11 [documentation](https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/compiling.html#building-manually).
